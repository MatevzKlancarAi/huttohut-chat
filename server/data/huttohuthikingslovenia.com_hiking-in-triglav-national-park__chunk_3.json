  "content": "The Park\nThe Triglav National Park is a park with\nendless trekking possibilities\n. From easy treks through\nstunning glacial valleys\nwith\npicturesque alpine villages\nand\ncrystal-clear rivers\n, to more challenging hikes through\nauthentic alpine pastures\n, walking on\npanoramic ridges\nlooking down on\npristine mountain lakes\n– everyone can find a trail for himself here. Look below to find your route, when to go and how to prepare.\nSeasons for Hiking\nIf you want to go hiking through the Triglav National Park, you must choose the right time of year according to your desired type of tour.\nTriglav lodge Kredarica on winter morning\nLowland tours and undemanding hikes are possible throughout the year,\nand most do not require a professional guide. The best time for such hikes is in late spring when the weather is not too hot, nature is in bloom, and you can see the beautiful contrast between the green valleys and the white peaks towering over it.\nThe\nearly autumn\nis attractive because of its beautiful colours, pleasant temperatures and stable weather. When the first snow falls and autumn starts turning into\nwinter\n, the conditions in the mountains become much more demanding. It’s the time only the most experienced go into the mountains alone. The snowed-over terrain demands more experience, special equipment, and the proper techniques to be experienced safely and enjoyably.\nSummer, the most popular season for trekking, is when the temperatures are higher, so most lowland hikes run through forests, gorges or alongside bodies of water, like the Martuljek waterfalls, Mostnica Gorge or the Soča River. That means that most can be easily combined with refreshing water activities like rafting, canyoning and kayaking.\nJune, July and August are the best months for hiking in higher mountainous terrain\n, as the snow has mostly melted. An early start is a must since temperatures are more bearable in the mornings and unpredictable afternoon storms are avoided.\nTrenta valley in autumn\nPreparing for a Triglav National Park hike\nWhat to pack mostly depends on the chosen tour. Striking the right balance between packing too much or too little is an art in itself. Pack too little, and you can get yourself in trouble with not having something crucial on you in the mountains. Pack too much, and you’ll feel the effect that will have on your shoulders and your overall tiredness, which can make the hike less enjoyable and also less safe, especially towards the end.\nAn experienced guide is always the best person to turn to for advice on which equipment to bring.\nIn general, you should take some extra warm layers of clothing, even during warm summer months. Other musts are a wind-stopper jacket and some hiking shoes/boots with excellent grip.\nThere are many areas within the Triglav National Park where phone reception is questionable, which means GPS might not work. Maps for navigation should therefore be stored in advance and phone battery saved in case of mishaps. The emergency number to call in Slovenia is 112.\nOn steeper, exposed and overall more demanding rocky trails, a\nhelmet is recommended\n, so the crumbly limestone rock doesn’t break off and injure your head. That kind of debris can be easily triggered by a hiker in front or a passing mountain goat.\nDon’t forget to\nbring enough water supplies\n, especially on routes without any tree cover. Water sources in the mountains are drinkable, but scarce because of the karst terrain. High-calorie food should also be packed, so you can replenish your energy when needed if there are no huts nearby.\nLate spring and winter is a whole new beast, as crampons, ice axe and maybe even avalanche safety gear is needed. Snowy patches can sometimes stay well into the summer.\nSlipping is the most common type of accident in the mountains. It mostly occurs due to inadequate equipment, exhaustion and/or not knowing the terrain.\nWe therefore strongly advise that any demanding or longer intermediate hikes are ventured on with a professional local guide.\nMost waters in the park are drinkable\nPopular Hiking Trails in the Triglav National Park\nThere are more than 800 kilometres of hiking trails in the Park, that are begging to be explored and reveal their natural treasures. Here are some of the highlights.\nThe Soča Trail\nThe 25-kilometer trail leads you\nalong the emerald green Soča River\n– from its source, leading you through the peaceful sections of the Trenta valley, crossing the footbridges hanging over the river and ending up in the picturesque town of Bovec. It is also a part of the much longer Alpe Adria Trail, that connects the Austrian and the Slovenian Alps with the Italian Adriatic coast.\nMostnica Gorge\nThis undemanding but lovely trail follows the\n2-km gorge of the Mostnica River above the village of Stara Fužina\n. The path runs along crystal river pools, which are sometimes up to 20 metres deep and later on continues to the scenic\nVoje Valley\n. Be on the lookout and don’t miss the gorge’s signature formation, a rock in the shape of an elephant’s head.\nHiking above the Pokljuka Plateau\nThe endless forests of the Pokljuka Plateau are an\nexcellent starting point for Triglav National Park hikes\n, since you start at a higher elevation and can reach panoramic peaks, that would otherwise take more time to reach. That’s what also makes it a\npopular hut-to-hut starting point\n, while from one day hikes, Viševnik is the easiest and the most panoramic.\nThe Seven Lakes Hike\nSome say the Seven Lakes or the\nTriglav Lakes Valley is the heart of the Triglav National Park\n, as it was also the first to be protected. The hike there takes you trekking across many\nauthentic alpine pastures\nand into the\nvalley of crystal clear mountain lakes\n. You can hike through the valley in one day, but it is best to include it as a part of your multi-day mountain tour. It is one of the biggest highlights of the Park, that’s why we included it into most of our Hut to Hut tours we prepared.\nHaving fun hiking in Slovenia\nMt. Triglav\nFor the more experienced hikers and those who want a bigger challenge, there is no better choice than a climb of the\nhighest mountain in Slovenia\nand the namesake of the Park. Triglav is one of the country’s most important symbols and nobody becomes a true Slovene until they reach its peak. For an all-around experience, include it in your\n3-day Hut to Hut Tour\n. If reaching the peak is your main goal, check out other\nTriglav Tours\n.\nJuliana Trail\nThis long-distance trail\ntakes you around the Julian Alps of Slovenia\n. It leads through scenic valleys, mountain passes, along rivers, through picturesque villages and towns. It allows you to discover the beauty of the Julian Alps region, without venturing too high into the mountains.\nExperience the\nbeauty of the Triglav National Park\non some of the best\nHut to Hut Hiking Tours\n."
