  "content": "Everything you need to know before setting off on an unforgettable hut to hut experience in Slovenia.\n\nSlovenia is a\ntop hiking destination\nwith trails everywhere around its mountain ranges. Even though the country is small, its landscape is so diverse, and the natural beauties so many that it’s easy not to see enough. That’s why hiking from one hut to another is the best way to see as much of its picturesque mountain scenery as possible while\nwaking up every day in a new environment\n. Its alpine ranges are covered very well by the\n163 huts\nmanaged by the Alpine Association of Slovenia.\nTo make the planning of your hut-to-hut tour in Slovenia easier, we have prepared this guide that touches on the most important things for you to consider.\nBest time of year to hike in Slovenia\nMost huts are open from\nJune to September\n. Before June, there’s usually still a lot of snow in the mountains. In October, a few of them stay open if there’s no early snow, but most of them finally close in November, when winter comes.\nThe most beautiful time to go is in\nearly summer\nsince the nature surrounding you is all green and blooming. There are also\nfewer people\nin June, and the\nday is long\n. The more you are closing in on the\nhigh season in August\n, the\nmore people\nthere are, temperatures are higher and the\nweather becomes more unstable\n.\nThat’s why\nSeptember\nis much better in these last two aspects since the temperatures are perfect, the weather stable and the\nhuts less crowded\nthan in August. Still, the new downsides are\nvery cold mornings\nand shorter days.\nVodnikov Dom an Velem Polju in early Autumn\nDaily weather\nThe main thing you have to consider about the weather in the summer is the\nheat\nand the\nafternoon storms\n. That’s why it’s best to start your hikes early in the morning to avoid these two things. A good rule of thumb is to\nstart descending before noon\nwhen the temperature is the highest, and clouds begin gathering around the peaks.\nOf course, that is not true for every day of summer, so it’s good to always check the daily weather forecast before planning your hike. Even though the temperatures can get very high during the day, they can sometimes be around zero in the morning. Additionally, when clouds block the sun and the wind starts blowing, the temperatures that were too high a minute ago turn into too cold in a second.\nOn a more positive note, there are also days without any storms, which are the best for hiking and are more prevalent the closer to autumn you get. The most important thing to remember is –\ncheck the local weather forecast\n, specialized for the mountains. Those forecasts are only reliable a few days ahead – you can check the weather forecast for the next three days in Slovenian Alps\nhere\n.\nHiking in the summer\nAbout the huts\nThere are a lot of huts in the Slovenian mountains, which have many commonalities between them. These are some things to keep in mind:\nWhat comfort to expect:\nAs the huts are often secluded and “away from civilization”, the general comfort is basic, but they are clean and cosy and have everything you need for a comfortable overnight stay.\nSleeping accommodation:\nMost huts have both dormitories and separate rooms, with the latter usually booked first. If you want to sleep in a private room, it’s better to book your accommodation early. The beds are generally comfortable, while the huts also provide you with blankets, bedding and pillows, but you can also bring your own liner for extra hygiene. Sometimes a liner is requisite, and if you don’t have your own you have to buy a disposable one.\nWater and showering facilities:\nLower-altitude lodges usually have their own drinking water source, while most high-altitude ones do not. They get their water supply by helicopter deliveries. Most still collect rainwater for toilets, while showers are a luxury only possible in low-altitude huts.\nFood and Drinks:\nHuts offer authentic traditional homemade dishes like stews, sausages, goulash etc. Breakfast is usually eggs or different kinds of spreads with bread, so taking the half-board package is worth it. Regarding drinks, you can buy bottled water for around 4,5 € per 1,5 litres. They also serve beer, wine and some home-brewed schnapps. For a quick boost of energy, they also offer snacks like chocolate bars.\nMountain hut etiquette:\nVisitors must behave in a manner that doesn’t disturb others, which means there are quiet hours from 10 PM until 5 AM. That’s why those who wake up earlier should do so as quietly as possible. Smoking inside the huts is also not allowed, and everyone must take their own trash back down to the valley.\nHuts in the Slovenian mountains are quite popular, which means they are often quite crowded. To find a good place to sleep, it’s best to\nbook them early\n.\nTo get a sense of what the huts are like, check out the\nlist of our favourite mountain lodges\n.\nEnjoying the view from Zasavska hut at Prehodavci\nWhat to take on a hut-to-hut tour?\nTry to pack light and only take what is necessary. It is always good to plan according to the route, the weather and other specific conditions, which means it’s best to consult with a guide before doing so.\nClothing:\nComfortable sports clothes\nSports shoes with good grip\nInsulation jacket\nExtra layers\nRain jacket\nHeadwear\nGloves\nSpare socks, underwear and shirts\nEven though it is summer and the weather is warm, it’s good to take enough\nextra layers\n, so you don’t get cold when the temperatures suddenly drop. We also recommend having a good\nsoftshell jacket\nfor wind protection, and a\nrain jacket\nwhen the forecast is sketchy.\nThe most important item you’ll have with you are your shoes. They need to be comfortable and previously worn, as that will lessen your chances of getting blisters substantially.\nNever go on a multi-day tour with new shoes!\nLow-cut hiking shoes or trail running shoes are good enough for any summer tour in Slovenia when the weather is dry. But the shoes must be sturdy enough to protect your feet from the rocks and have a grippy outsole that prevents slippage.\nDo not go on a hike in regular sports sneakers!\nIn early summer (for crossing the snow left) or rainy days, it’s better to wear high-cut waterproof shoes or even boots.\nAppropriate vs inappropriate hiking footwear\nFor overnight stays in huts:\nSleeping liner (disposable can be bought in the hut)\nSome cash for food and accommodation\nUIAA membership card for accommodation discount\nToothbrush\nEarplugs\nID card\nPowerbank (power sockets are often taken)\nCredit cards are usually accepted in huts, but because they depend on the unreliable internet signal, it’s best to also\ntake enough cash\n. An ID card is necessary for the hut check-in, where you can also present your UIAA membership card to get a discount."
