We also have some long-distance trails, and except for the Slovenian Mountain Trail and the Via Alpina, most of them run through valleys (Juliana Trail, Alpe-Adria Trail etc.).\nPlanning a tour in the high mountains requires more knowledge. It’s not easy to get information about the time needed to hike from hut to hut since routes are mostly marked and timed from an access point in the valley to the final destination. The\ntimes needed are approximate\nand sometimes not uniform, so your hiking time can vary, depending on how used you are to a type of terrain.\nThe more popular routes are marked well, but some of the less known ones are not, so it can even look like there is no path there. The crossroad signs also list many different destination names, which can be confusing if you aren’t familiar with them.\nThe difficulty scale of Slovenian hiking trails consists of:\nEasy trails:\nWalking without the use of hands.\nDifficult trails:\nOccasional use of hands. Steel cables and other equipment to increase safety.\nVery difficult trails:\nUse of hands is mandatory with steel cables, iron pegs and other equipment on the route to ease your way up and increase safety.\nWhile you don’t need much hiking experience on easy trails, you shouldn’t underestimate them. The\ndifficulty scale only describes how technical the terrain is\n, but says nothing about the length and steepness of the trail or the ease of orientation. The difficult trails often have steel cables and other equipment to increase safety, but their condition varies. It’s best to\nresearch each route separately\n, before setting off on a hike.\nRoute to Kriški Podi is considered partly difficult\nHow to best plan your hut-to-hut tour in Slovenia?\nThere are a lot of different aspects one has to consider when planning a hut-to-hut tour in Slovenia – booking the huts, local weather, knowing the terrain, the timetables.

Slovenia is a\ntop hiking destination\nwith trails everywhere around its mountain ranges. Even though the country is small, its landscape is so diverse, and the natural beauties so many that it’s easy not to see enough. That’s why hiking from one hut to another is the best way to see as much of its picturesque mountain scenery as possible while\nwaking up every day in a new environment\n. Its alpine ranges are covered very well by the\n163 huts\nmanaged by the Alpine Association of Slovenia.\nTo make the planning of your hut-to-hut tour in Slovenia easier, we have prepared this guide that touches on the most important things for you to consider.\nBest time of year to hike in Slovenia\nMost huts are open from\nJune to September\n. Before June, there’s usually still a lot of snow in the mountains. In October, a few of them stay open if there’s no early snow, but most of them finally close in November, when winter comes.\nThe most beautiful time to go is in\nearly summer\nsince the nature surrounding you is all green and blooming. There are also\nfewer people\nin June, and the\nday is long\n. The more you are closing in on the\nhigh season in August\n, the\nmore people\nthere are, temperatures are higher and the\nweather becomes more unstable\n.\nThat’s why\nSeptember\nis much better in these last two aspects since the temperatures are perfect, the weather stable and the\nhuts less crowded\nthan in August. Still, the new downsides are\nvery cold mornings\nand shorter days.\nVodnikov Dom an Velem Polju in early Autumn\nDaily weather\nThe main thing you have to consider about the weather in the summer is the\nheat\nand the\nafternoon storms\n. That’s why it’s best to start your hikes early in the morning to avoid these two things. A good rule of thumb is to\nstart descending before noon\nwhen the temperature is the highest, and clouds begin gathering around the peaks.\nOf course, that is not true for every day of summer, so it’s good to always check the daily weather forecast before planning your hike. Even though the temperatures can get very high during the day, they can sometimes be around zero in the morning. Additionally, when clouds block the sun and the wind starts blowing, the temperatures that were too high a minute ago turn into too cold in a second.\nOn a more positive note, there are also days without any storms, which are the best for hiking and are more prevalent the closer to autumn you get. The most important thing to remember is –\ncheck the local weather forecast\n, specialized for the mountains. Those forecasts are only reliable a few days ahead – you can check the weather forecast for the next three days in Slovenian Alps\nhere\n.\nHiking in the summer\nAbout the huts\nThere are a lot of huts in the Slovenian mountains, which have many commonalities between them. These are some things to keep in mind:\nWhat comfort to expect:\nAs the huts are often secluded and “away from civilization”, the general comfort is basic, but they are clean and cosy and have everything you need for a comfortable overnight stay.\nSleeping accommodation:\nMost huts have both dormitories and separate rooms, with the latter usually booked first. If you want to sleep in a private room, it’s better to book your accommodation early. The beds are generally comfortable, while the huts also provide you with blankets, bedding and pillows, but you can also bring your own liner for extra hygiene. Sometimes a liner is requisite, and if you don’t have your own you have to buy a disposable one.\nWater and showering facilities:\nLower-altitude lodges usually have their own drinking water source, while most high-altitude ones do not. They get their water supply by helicopter deliveries."
