  "content": "Most still collect rainwater for toilets, while showers are a luxury only possible in low-altitude huts.\nFood and Drinks:\nHuts offer authentic traditional homemade dishes like stews, sausages, goulash etc. Breakfast is usually eggs or different kinds of spreads with bread, so taking the half-board package is worth it. Regarding drinks, you can buy bottled water for around 4,5 € per 1,5 litres. They also serve beer, wine and some home-brewed schnapps. For a quick boost of energy, they also offer snacks like chocolate bars.\nMountain hut etiquette:\nVisitors must behave in a manner that doesn’t disturb others, which means there are quiet hours from 10 PM until 5 AM. That’s why those who wake up earlier should do so as quietly as possible. Smoking inside the huts is also not allowed, and everyone must take their own trash back down to the valley.\nHuts in the Slovenian mountains are quite popular, which means they are often quite crowded. To find a good place to sleep, it’s best to\nbook them early\n.\nTo get a sense of what the huts are like, check out the\nlist of our favourite mountain lodges\n.\nEnjoying the view from Zasavska hut at Prehodavci\nWhat to take on a hut-to-hut tour?\nTry to pack light and only take what is necessary. It is always good to plan according to the route, the weather and other specific conditions, which means it’s best to consult with a guide before doing so.\nClothing:\nComfortable sports clothes\nSports shoes with good grip\nInsulation jacket\nExtra layers\nRain jacket\nHeadwear\nGloves\nSpare socks, underwear and shirts\nEven though it is summer and the weather is warm, it’s good to take enough\nextra layers\n, so you don’t get cold when the temperatures suddenly drop. We also recommend having a good\nsoftshell jacket\nfor wind protection, and a\nrain jacket\nwhen the forecast is sketchy.\nThe most important item you’ll have with you are your shoes. They need to be comfortable and previously worn, as that will lessen your chances of getting blisters substantially.\nNever go on a multi-day tour with new shoes!\nLow-cut hiking shoes or trail running shoes are good enough for any summer tour in Slovenia when the weather is dry. But the shoes must be sturdy enough to protect your feet from the rocks and have a grippy outsole that prevents slippage.\nDo not go on a hike in regular sports sneakers!\nIn early summer (for crossing the snow left) or rainy days, it’s better to wear high-cut waterproof shoes or even boots.\nAppropriate vs inappropriate hiking footwear\nFor overnight stays in huts:\nSleeping liner (disposable can be bought in the hut)\nSome cash for food and accommodation\nUIAA membership card for accommodation discount\nToothbrush\nEarplugs\nID card\nPowerbank (power sockets are often taken)\nCredit cards are usually accepted in huts, but because they depend on the unreliable internet signal, it’s best to also\ntake enough cash\n. An ID card is necessary for the hut check-in, where you can also present your UIAA membership card to get a discount. A sleeping bag is not needed, as the hut provides all the blankets, bedding and pillows.\nOther equipment:\nHiking backpack 25-30 l\nTrekking poles (if you are used to them)\nSnacks (for the time between huts)\nWater bottle with enough water and a sports drink with electrolytes\nSunscreen\nToilet paper\nHeadlamp\nAlpine Ibex in Julian Alps\nHiking routes in Slovenia\nSlovenia has\nmore than 10,000 kilometres of marked hiking trails\n, ranging from easy walks to difficult climbs. We also have some long-distance trails, and except for the Slovenian Mountain Trail and the Via Alpina, most of them run through valleys (Juliana Trail, Alpe-Adria Trail etc.).\nPlanning a tour in the high mountains requires more knowledge. It’s not easy to get information about the time needed to hike from hut to hut since routes are mostly marked and timed from an access point in the valley to the final destination. The\ntimes needed are approximate\nand sometimes not uniform, so your hiking time can vary, depending on how used you are to a type of terrain.\nThe more popular routes are marked well, but some of the less known ones are not, so it can even look like there is no path there. The crossroad signs also list many different destination names, which can be confusing if you aren’t familiar with them.\nThe difficulty scale of Slovenian hiking trails consists of:\nEasy trails:\nWalking without the use of hands.\nDifficult trails:\nOccasional use of hands. Steel cables and other equipment to increase safety.\nVery difficult trails:\nUse of hands is mandatory with steel cables, iron pegs and other equipment on the route to ease your way up and increase safety.\nWhile you don’t need much hiking experience on easy trails, you shouldn’t underestimate them. The\ndifficulty scale only describes how technical the terrain is\n, but says nothing about the length and steepness of the trail or the ease of orientation. The difficult trails often have steel cables and other equipment to increase safety, but their condition varies. It’s best to\nresearch each route separately\n, before setting off on a hike.\nRoute to Kriški Podi is considered partly difficult\nHow to best plan your hut-to-hut tour in Slovenia?\nThere are a lot of different aspects one has to consider when planning a hut-to-hut tour in Slovenia – booking the huts, local weather, knowing the terrain, the timetables. That’s why it’s best to\nhave someone experienced in your group\nwho can help you with all of that.\nOf course, a local friend as a guide is one option, but that can sometimes give you false confidence.
