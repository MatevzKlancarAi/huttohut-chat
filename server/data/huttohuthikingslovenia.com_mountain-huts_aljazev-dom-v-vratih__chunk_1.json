  "content": "Aljažev dom used to be filled with alpinists planning on climbing Triglav’s north face every weekend when cars were still not as common as today. Otherwise, the drive from Mojstrana takes 20 minutes, with a spacious parking area just 5 minutes from the lodge, making it a very well-visited spot during summer.\n\nBuilt on the ground of the Vrata alpine valley, it is surrounded by commanding mountain peaks that all reach well above 2500 meters of elevation. Therefore, the views are scarce, but witnessing Triglav’s 1000-meter-high awe-inspiring north face in person is a memorable experience. Additionally, the valley visitors usually stop on the way to Aljažev dom to see the stunning Peričnik waterfall."
