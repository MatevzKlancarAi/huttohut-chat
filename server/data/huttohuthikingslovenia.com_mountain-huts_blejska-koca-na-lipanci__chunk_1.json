  "title": "Blejska koča na Lipanci - Part 1",
  "content": "Occupying a spot on the Lipanca mountain pasture below the slopes of the Brda and Mrežce peaks, Blejska hut is a popular hiking destination for families with younger children. Pokljuka Plateau offers scenic and undulating paths through its serene woods, with hikers not having to overcome severe elevation gains or wander into steep terrain.\n\nRising just slightly above Pokljuka, the lodge allows for far-reaching views across the plateau’s vastness towards the mountains above Bohinj and even the Kamnik-Savinja Alps. It is worth mentioning that visitors will find the hut’s doors open to them even mid-winter."
