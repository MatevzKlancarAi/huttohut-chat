  "content": "Captured inside a hollow between the northern slopes of Begunjščica and the Na Možeh ridge, Dom na Zelenici might not offer the most far-reaching views among all Slovenian mountain huts, but its strategic location serves as a great starting point for hikes towards many of the surrounding peaks. Besides, it is somewhat majestic and humbling to stare up at the commanding walls of rock.\n\nZelenica is also known for its reliable and long-lasting snow conditions in the winter, making it one of Slovenia’s most popular ski-touring destinations. Therefore, the hut stays operational even during the snowy months but limits its working hours to the weekends."
