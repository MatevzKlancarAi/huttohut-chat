  "content": "In our guided tours, we take care of the reservations for you, and you pay for the huts together with food on the spot.  In most huts, you can pay with a credit card, but it is advisable to bring some cash just in case if the internet is down – After all, you’re in the mountains. If you are a member of the UIAA Alpine Association, bring your card and you will get a discount.\nFor our self-guided tours, the accommodation with breakfast is included in the price.\n\nCell reception is on and off in most parts of the Julian Alps. The reception is generally better on the peaks and exposed parts and worse in secluded valleys. Some huts offer paid wifi option, but not all.\n\nMost of the mountain huts only operate from June to September. Some huts are open sooner and longer, but those times change from season to season according to weather and snow conditions.\nRead about best seasons for hiking in Slovenia.\nIf conditions are favourable we can make a\ncustom tour\neven before June or after September.\n\nMost of the tours can be done even in light rain, as long as you dress accordingly. It is not unusual in the summer that there are afternoon thunderstorms, so early starts are advisable. If the weather looks really bad, we will try to reschedule or propose an alternative tour.\n\nTry to pack light, only take what you really need. You need your passport or ID for check-in, and some cash is advisable if the internet is down. Bring your sleeping liner and earplugs for the night, and toothbrush and body wipes for hygiene. You don’t need slippers, they are in the hut already.\n\n×"
