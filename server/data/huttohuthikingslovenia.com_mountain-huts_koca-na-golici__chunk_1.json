  "content": "Golica gets especially attractive as a hiking destination at the end of May and beginning of June when blooming daffodils cover its grassy slopes, making it seem almost as if they are covered in snow. The hut lies below the ridge and serves its visitors with magical views of Jesenice below and the Julian Alps across the valley.\n\nHikers undertaking the Slovenian Mountain Trail will find shelter here after a strenuous day traversing the Karawanks ridges from Mt. Stol."
