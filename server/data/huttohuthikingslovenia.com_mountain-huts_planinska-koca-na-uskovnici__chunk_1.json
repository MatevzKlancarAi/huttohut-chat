  "title": "Planinska koča na Uskovnici - Part 1",
  "content": "The hut adorns the scenic Uskovnica mountain pasture on the western part of the Pokljuka Plateau and offers panoramic views of the Bohinj valley and mountains on its southern side. It has recently been built anew on the spot where the old complex had stood since 1955. The new building combines a modern look with better efficiency and preserves the authenticity of traditional Slovenian mountain huts at the same time.\n\nLying at a relatively low altitude, it remains open throughout the year, hosting mountain enthusiasts even in the coldest months. As such, it is an attractive destination, either for a day’s walk in Pokljuka, spending a night, or a quick stop on the way to Viševnik or one of the other surrounding mountain peaks."
