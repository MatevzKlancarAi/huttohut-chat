  "title": "Prešernova koča na Stolu - Part 1",
  "content": "The hut was named after Slovenia’s most famous poet, France Prešeren, who also wrote the lyrics to Slovenia’s national anthem. It sits well above 2000 meters of altitude and less than 100 vertical meters below the peak of the highest mountain in the Karawanks, Stol. Sleeping there is among the closest experiences to sleeping on a mountaintop with all the comfort you need for a restful night.\n\nWith an open view in all directions, hikers can see far into the Ljubljana basin, toward the Julian Alps, Kamnik Savinja Alps, and even into Austria. While the border between the two countries runs right along Mt. Stol’s ridge, the hut lies entirely on the Slovenian side, adorning the gentle and grassy slopes to the south."
