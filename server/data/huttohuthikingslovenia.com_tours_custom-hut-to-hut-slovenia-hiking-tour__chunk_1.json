  "title": "Custom Hut to Hut Slovenia Hiking Tour - Part 1",
  "content": "With all the mountains you could climb in Slovenia it would be a shame to only stick to the most popular ones.\n\nThere are endless options for tours that suit any kind of mountain lover, regardless of your technical skills, experience, or fitness.\n\nFrom very easy hikes that focus on enjoying the Alpine surroundings and can even\n\nbe adapted for families with children\n\n, to incredibly\n\ndemanding tours\n\nthat include via Ferrata and rock climbing, there is something for everyone.\n\nYou aren’t even limited to the Julian Alps! Despite their incredible beauty, Slovenia also has two other mountain ranges that are equally worth visiting –\n\nthe Kamnik-Savinja Alps and the Karawanks\n\n. These give more options for interesting, varied, and most importantly\n\nless crowded hut to hut tours\n\n. We can even lead you off the beaten path, into areas where we will be more likely to come across a chamois than another person.\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\nPlanning a custom hut to hut tour takes time and because we want to make the perfect route for you, please inquire about custom hut to hut tours early enough, before the season starts!"
