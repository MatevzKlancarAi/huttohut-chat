  "title": "Pokljuka Family Hut to Hut Hike - Part 1",
  "content": "Amid Slovenia’s steep mountain slopes and technical rocky terrain that often have a discouraging effect on families with children,\n\nPokljuka Plateau\n\nhits the sweet spot between an undemanding walking turf and a first-row view of the\n\nJulian Alps\n\n.\n\nMeandering through the woods of Pokljuka, you will follow the trail across authentic\n\nmountain pastures\n\n, sip on homemade sour milk, and catch yourself stealing glances at\n\nMt. Triglav\n\n, Slovenia’s highest mountain.\n\nElevated between\n\nBled\n\nand\n\nBohinj\n\n, Pokljuka Plateau is the ideal place for a family hiking adventure. Its ground is relatively flat, only gradually rising towards the mountain peaks of Debela Peč, Mrežce, Viševnik, and others above the\n\nKrma valley\n\n.\n\nShort hiking stages take you to two authentic mountain huts,\n\nBlejska Hut and Uskovnica Hut\n\n, where you will spend your nights. In case of an emergency, there are several escape routes to take you back to Goreljek, as you will never be too far from the main road, even though you will barely feel it.\n\nIn any case, we will be available\n\n24/7 for support\n\nduring your hike. We will also book your places in the mountain huts in advance and equip you with a detailed handbook, including a GPS track with\n\nphone-app navigation\n\n. You can also get a\n\nguide\n\nupon your request.\n\nThe sooner you book the tour with us, the larger your chances of getting a spot in the mountain huts!"
