  "content": "A three-day hiking tour in the\n\nJulian Alps\n\nallows you to see\n\nthe best of this mountain range in a short time\n\n. This is the most popular multi day mountain trip in Slovenia, and one of the most mesmerizing hikes in all of Europe. We will hike through an\n\nincredibly varied landscape\n\n, with new sights to marvel at every day.\n\nThe path will take you through the famous\n\nValley of the Triglav Lakes\n\n, also known as the\n\nSeven Lakes Valley\n\n, surrounded by the highest summits of the Julian Alps.\n\nApart from crystal clear high mountain lakes, we will also come across\n\nmountain pastures\n\nthat provided livelihood to shepherds in these parts for centuries, and still do in some cases, so we’ll see plenty of sheep and cows. With a bit of luck we’ll also spot some\n\nwildlife residing in the high mountains like the chamois, ibex, and marmot.\n\nWe will find our shelter in\n\nmountain huts\n\n, which will provide us with\n\nauthentic Slovenian meals and basic comfort\n\nfor an overnight stay. The atmosphere in these cabins is truly amazing, which is not surprising, since it is full of people who spent the day in nature, breathing clean mountain air, and getting their dose of hiking endorphins.\n\nA three-day hut to hut is the perfect introduction to this type of mountaineering. On this Triglav Lakes Valley hike we will be able to walk through a good part of the Julian Alps, without excessive physical and technical difficulty. We will mostly walk through high mountain valleys, and enjoy the views of high peaks around us. The 7 Lakes Valley Hut to Hut is, therefore,\n\nsuitable for anyone who is able to walk for half of the day\n\n– with regular breaks to regain our strengths, of course.\n\nThe richness of the Julian Alps offers plenty of opportunities for\n\nadapting your tour\n\n, and you will be able to take full advantage of that with a\n\nprivate tour\n\n. We can also include a Triglav summit in your tour if some of you are hungry for an extra challenge.\n\nNOTE: The mountain huts can be busy in the summer. To ensure your spot in the lodges,\n\nwe recommend booking the tour as soon as possible\n\n, especially for the weekends. For last-minute bookings, we cannot guarantee a free spot in the chosen lodge, but we will try our best or find the most suitable alternative for you."
