  "content": "Our guided tours are led by UIMLA or IMFGA internationally licensed guides who have completed many years of training to make your hut to hut hike both safe and enjoyable. They are passionate individuals who call the Slovenian mountains their second home and are ready to share this adventure with you.\n\nDifferent huts have different options and sometimes, private rooms for 2 or 4 persons are available. It is not the rule and they require a very early booking. We will try to get you the best possible accommodation from what is available at the time of your booking.\n\nWe recommend booking as early as possible. Slovenian mountain huts are very popular and get booked up several weeks in advance, especially on weekends. If your booking is late, we will try our best to find a suitable alternative. Sometimes, last-minute spots open up. However, we cannot guarantee a free spot.\n\nNo, all of the huts provide blankets, bedding and pillows, but you can bring your own silk or cotton sleeping liner.\n\nAll of the huts offer vegetarian options and usually at least one vegan option. Still, kitchens high up are basic, so don’t expect too many choices. Huts generally serve authentic meals like stews, soups, and sausages. If you have strict dietary restrictions, consider bringing your own food as they can’t make a special meal per request.\n\nMost high-altitude huts in Slovenia don’t have a drinking water source, but you can buy bottled water for around 4,5€ per 1,5l. You can also bring a water purifier and filter rainwater or water from the lakes. There are also some freshwater sources on the way so you never have to carry too much.\n\nIn our guided tours, we take care of the reservations for you, and you pay for the huts together with food on the spot.  In most huts, you can pay with a credit card, but it is advisable to bring some cash just in case if the internet is down – After all, you’re in the mountains. If you are a member of the UIAA Alpine Association, bring your card and you will get a discount.\nFor our self-guided tours, the accommodation with breakfast is included in the price.\n\nCell reception is on and off in most parts of the Julian Alps. The reception is generally better on the peaks and exposed parts and worse in secluded valleys. Some huts offer paid wifi option, but not all.\n\nMost of the mountain huts only operate from June to September. Some huts are open sooner and longer, but those times change from season to season according to weather and snow conditions.\nRead about best seasons for hiking in Slovenia.\nIf conditions are favourable we can make a\ncustom tour\neven before June or after September.\n\nMost of the tours can be done even in light rain, as long as you dress accordingly. It is not unusual in the summer that there are afternoon thunderstorms, so early starts are advisable. If the weather looks really bad, we will try to reschedule or propose an alternative tour.\n\nTry to pack light, only take what you really need. You need your passport or ID for check-in, and some cash is advisable if the internet is down. Bring your sleeping liner and earplugs for the night, and toothbrush and body wipes for hygiene. You don’t need slippers, they are in the hut already.\n\n×"
