  "content": "The Slovenian Mountain Trail Highlights Hike is the ideal way to immerse yourself in the charm of the\n\nJulian Alps and the Karawanks\n\n. From the breathtaking views atop Mt. Stol to the scenic\n\nTriglav Lakes Valley\n\n, this trip offers a truly unique experience.\n\nThe route runs along the least technically demanding and picturesque section of the famous\n\nSlovenian Mountain Trail\n\n, the ultimate hiking challenge in the country. Although the path is adapted to be doable for any regular hiker, it includes some rocky passages and height exposure but requires no scrambling or climbing skills.\n\nStarting in the Karawanks on the Austrian border, the track will lead you along grassy ridges, across\n\nmeadows and mountain pastures\n\n, and through alpine valleys before dropping you off in the heart of the Julian Alps next to\n\nLake Bohinj\n\n. But not before introducing you to the towering north face of Mt. Triglav and the Peričnik Waterfall in the\n\nTriglav National Park\n\n.\n\nPassing kilometers in the stunning mountain landscape of the Alps, you will rest your legs in\n\ncozy mountain huts\n\nalong the way. These lodges offer a warm and welcoming atmosphere with a chance to meet other hikers and learn about the local culture, including trying the\n\nauthentic local dishes\n\n.\n\nWe strive to make your experience as comfortable and convenient as possible. That’s why we take care of\n\nbooking your spots\n\nin the mountain huts in advance and provide you with a\n\nbooklet\n\nthat includes a detailed itinerary and\n\nGPS navigation\n\nalong the planned route. Our team will offer you\n\nsupport\n\nduring your hike as well.\n\nThe tour is\n\ncustomizable\n\n, with options for extra days before the first stage and after the last one. If you\n\nshare your wishes with us\n\n, we can start sorting out the itinerary to suit your needs in no time."
