  "content": "This five-day tour will not only give you a\n\nproper introduction to the Julian Alps\n\nbut also let you explore the Soča Valley and marvel at the beauty of its\n\nemerald green river Soča\n\n.\n\nThis is a relatively easy hiking tour that will let you enjoy the amazing sights surrounding you without excessive physical strain. Our time in the high mountain range of the Julian Alps will mostly be spent in the valleys that are nestled between high peaks. We will cross\n\nmountain pastures full of authentic shepherd’s cottages\n\n, and also hike through the breathtaking\n\nTriglav Lakes Valley\n\n. Our daily hearty meal and night’s rest will be provided by mountain huts, the core of Slovenia’s hiking culture that will make our hiking tour that much more authentic.\n\nAfter two days of hiking around the high mountains\n\nand a night spent in a mountain hut, we will\n\ndescend in the Trenta Valley\n\n. This will give us the opportunity to have a well-needed shower, and restore our supplies. After\n\na day in the Soča Valley\n\n, we return to the\n\nhigher altitudes of Komna\n\nand then head to Bohinj.\n\nCarved by the River Soča, the Soča Valley is one of the most beautiful parts of Slovenia. We will dedicate a whole day to hiking the scenic\n\nAlpe-Adria trail that follows the river\n\n, marveling at the rapids and gorges of the jewel-like waters of the Soča. We might even go for a swim, or just tip our toes in the freezing cold water. Our exploration of the Soča Valley will also lead us to\n\nstunning waterfalls in Šumnikov gaj\n\n, the idyllic natural beauty of the Lepena Valley.\n\nThe day in the valley gives you the\n\nopportunity to take a break\n\nand rest your legs for the final two days, so you can also spend the day relaxing and taking in the sights, substituting most of the walking with a shuttle ride.\n\nThis tour mostly sees us walking along valleys, and gives us the option of\n\nbeing in the heart of the mountains with constant incredible views\n\n, without having to climb the high peaks. However, if you decide to go on a\n\nprivate tour, the itinerary can be customized\n\nto include some harder climbs and more impressive summits.\n\nThis is a circular tour, as it starts and ends in Bohinj, which gives you a great opportunity to spend some time in this beautiful town by Lake Bohinj.\n\nNOTE\n\n:\n\nDue to high demand and limited availability of accommodations in Soča Valley, this tour requires a very early booking,\n\n6-9 months in advance\n\n. For later bookings, the price can vary."
