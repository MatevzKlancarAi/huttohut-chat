  "title": "Triglav Panorama Hut to Hut Hike - Part 1",
  "content": "This tour takes you through the\n\nheart of the Julian Alps\n\nwhile sticking to the technically less demanding wooded slopes, grassy ridges, and picturesque pastures. A bit easier than our\n\nSeven Lakes Valley Hut to Hut Hike\n\ndue to being less rocky, it boasts one of the most beautiful views of Mt. Triglav and is doable\n\noff-season\n\nwhen the majority of the huts already close their doors.\n\nThe route takes you from\n\nBohinj\n\nto the\n\nPokljuka Plateau\n\nand can include a descent to\n\nBled\n\n. Along the way, you will come across many\n\nmountain pastures\n\n, each boasting a unique identity with its wooden cottages and lively Alpine ambiance.\n\nYou will run into a few steeper climbs but mostly hike on\n\npleasant forest paths\n\nacross Pokljuka Plateau, follow the\n\nMostnica River\n\nalong the Voje Valley, and\n\ntraverse a wide ridge\n\nabove the Krma Valley.\n\nThere will not be any lack of views either. Aside from the\n\nscenic ridgeline\n\nand the\n\nmajestic view of Mt. Triglav\n\n, you will also find yourself stopping to glance back at Bohinj and the mountains on the southern side of the valley.\n\nAnd to top it all off, you will spend at least two nights in the heart of the Triglav National Park, away from the hustle and bustle of the urban areas. The\n\nBlejska and Uskovnica mountain huts\n\nhave been recently renovated and offer enough comfort while keeping you well-fed with their delicious\n\ntraditional meals\n\nfrom local ingredients.\n\nThe whole path allows a lot of\n\nflexibility\n\n, and we can adjust this hut-to-hut hiking tour to your preferences, experience, and capabilities. We can include a\n\nclimb to any surrounding mountain peaks\n\nif the conditions allow it or\n\nextend your stay\n\nby taking you even further into the pristine nature of the Julian Alps.\n\nIf you do not feel confident enough to take this trip by yourself, we can arrange for a professional\n\nmountain guide\n\nto accompany you.\n\nYou will also receive\n\n24/7 support\n\nfrom our team and an\n\noptional transfer\n\nto and from Bohinj or Bled.\n\nNOTE\n\n: Be sure to book enough time in advance, as the huts can get quite busy, especially during summer."
