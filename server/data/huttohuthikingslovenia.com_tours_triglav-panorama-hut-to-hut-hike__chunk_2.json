  "content": "Day 1: Bohinj to Pokljuka\n\nThe tour begins in\n\nBohinj\n\n, the village of Stara Fužina, to be precise. The initial kilometers will gradually warm you up as you follow the Mostnica River through the picturesque\n\nVoje Valley\n\n. The river formed numerous erosion potholes in its river bed, molding the stunning\n\nMostnica Gorge\n\n.\n\nAfter reaching the end of the valley, you will be able to enjoy the calm natural ambiance of the\n\nVoje Waterfall\n\n. If you are up for grabbing a bite of delicious local cuisine, you can do so at the nearby hut. A steeper and physically more demanding climb to the Uskovnica mountain pasture follows.\n\nThe trail winds through a shadowy forest and is not too difficult, but it requires basic stamina, hiking experience, and proper footwear. After reaching a wider cart track, the incline gets less steep, and you soon reach the recently-renovated\n\nUskovnica Alpine Hut\n\n, where you spend the night.\n\nHiking\n\n9 km (5,6 mi), 800 vertical meters up (2600 feet), 200 meters down (660 feet)\n\nAccommodation\n\nPlaninska koča na Uskovnici\n\n×\n\nDay 2: Ridge above Krma Valley\n\nYou’ll start the day with a gradual ascent towards the charming\n\nKonjščica mountain pasture\n\n. The subsequent climb towards the Srenjski Preval pass gets steeper and rockier, especially toward the top of it.\n\nAfter that, you can opt for a climb up the Viševnik, but the trail is quite exposed. If not, however, you will follow the grassy ridge across the\n\nDebeli Vrh mountain peak\n\nuntil you descend to the cozy\n\nBlejska Hut\n\non the Lipanca mountain pasture, where you spend the second night.\n\nBreathtaking views over the\n\nJulian Alps\n\nwill accompany you while walking along the ridgeline. This stage offers one of the most mesmerizing views of Slovenia’s highest mountain peak,\n\nMt. Triglav\n\n.\n\nHiking\n\n11 km (6,8 mi), 1100 vertical meters up (3600 feet), 950 meters down (3200 feet)\n\nAccommodation\n\nBlejska koča na Lipanci\n\n×\n\nDay 3: Debela Peč summit and descent to Pokljuka\n\nYour final day will see you\n\nascend above\n\n2000 meters of elevation\n\n, climbing one of the best viewpoints in the area. The climb to the\n\nDebela Peč\n\nmountain peak is gradual and pleasant and shouldn’t be too big of a challenge for your tired legs. In any case, you can always decide to skip it if your energy level won’t allow it, as you’ll be descending by the same route.\n\nYou’ll follow the path through the wooded Pokljuka Plateau afterward until you reach the\n\nZajavornik mountain pasture\n\n, where you can visit an authentic cheese dairy and buy\n\nlocally produced cheese\n\n. From there, it’s not far to the Goreljek sports hotel, where your adventure concludes.\n\nA\n\nfree bus\n\nwill pick you up at the intersection with the main road, only\n\na few minutes from Goreljek\n\n. It can take you to\n\nBohinj\n\nor\n\nBled\n\n, where you can spend some additional nights if you wish.\n\nThe bus does not operate outside the summer season, but we can arrange a\n\ntransfer\n\nfor you if you visit during that time.\n\nHiking\n\n11 km (6,8 mi), 550 vertical meters up (1800 feet), 950 meters down (3200 feet)\n\n×\n\nExtra days: Descent to Bohinj or Bled\n\nAdditionally, you can extend your hiking through the\n\nfourth day\n\nby sleeping at the hotel in Goreljek and descending to Bled or Bohinj in the morning.\n\nIf you wish to return to where you began, you can head over the Pokljuka Plateau toward the\n\nZajamniki mountain pasture\n\n. It’s one of the most stunning places in the Julian Alps, where you can delight in the view of the whole pasture, dotted with wooden shepherd huts and a mountain vista in the background. After that, you follow a steeper path descending to\n\nStara Fužina\n\n.\n\nDescending to Bled is another option if you wish to visit\n\nLake Bled\n\n. You will strike across the Pokljuka Plateau, visit some less-known mountain pastures, and gently descend to Bled. You’ll know you’re at the end when you see the magical lake with an island in its middle!\n\n×"
