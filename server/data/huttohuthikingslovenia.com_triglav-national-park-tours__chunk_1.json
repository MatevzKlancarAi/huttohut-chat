Each voyage into this territory is a day full of childlike wonder, as there is always something new and unexpected to see. Even locals haven’t seen half of it.\nFirst the collision of tectonic plates, then the sculpturing by water; All this made the mountainous landscape of the Triglav National Park, as it is today. Full of\ngrey limestone mountain groups\n,\nsharp ridges\n, high-altitude\nkarst plateaus\n, U-shaped\nglacial valleys\n, deep\nravines\n,\ncrystal clear streams\n, majestic\nwaterfalls\nand more.\nAll of the above can be seen from afar, but it gets even more diverse if you look closer. The Park is full of various ecosystems.\nForests, peat bogs, streams and rivers\nare the most reachable, as they are more prevalent at lower altitudes. Going higher into “the kingdom of the Goldhorn”, the alpine lakes are surrounded by high-altitude\nmeadows\n, and\nrock cliffs\ntower over\nscree fields\n.\nRoad to Mangart Slovenia\nIt is a paradise for nature lovers, but don’t worry, it is not absent from human activity.\nThe area is also rich in cultural heritage\n. Especially on the outskirts of the Park, man has adapted to nature and became a part of it. From the historic\nVršič Pass\nroad with the Russian Chapel, the\nWW1 remains\nin the Krn range, the\nAljaž Turret\non the top of Triglav, to the many\nalpine pastures with authentic dwellings\n, they all became an important part of the landscape.\nSightseeing Trips\nThe easiest way to see the beauty of the Triglav National Park is by\ncar\n, as the park is a relatively short drive from the capital city of Ljubljana. The park is also well covered by roads, mostly with enough space to park close to the main attractions. If you’re unsure where to turn in regards to hiring a car, you can check out specialised services such as\nKAYAK\n.\nLake Bohinj and the Pokljuka Plateau\nAbout half an hour of a highway drive from Ljubljana, take a turnoff for Lake Bled. Although this highly popular destination is itself not in the Park, it is from where you can reach the bigger\nLake Bohinj\nand the\nPokljuka plateau\n, which are.\nBesides swimming in the clean water of Lake Bohinj, take a gondola lift to the\npanoramic Vogel mountain\nor check out the\nMostnica Gorge in the Voje valley\n. If you’re feeling more adventurous, try out kayaking or\nrafting on the Sava Bohinjka river\n.\nAerial view of Bohinj valley\nThe Pokljuka plateau is covered by spruce forest,\nperfect for relaxing walks in nature\n. Because of its high altitude, it is also an excellent starting point for\neasy hikes to high mountains\n, like the\nhike to Viševnik\n, with an up-close view to Triglav.\nMojstrana and the Triglav Alpine Valleys\nFrom Bled, go past the\nVintgar gorge\nand through the\nRadovna valley and Lake Kreda\nto arrive in the small alpine village of\nMojstrana\n. The village’s history has always been closely connected with the mountains surrounding it, as priest\nJakob Aljaž\nhere bought the land on top of Triglav, built the turret and kept the peak Slovenian, in a time where there the mountains here were under a lot of German influence. If you’re a fan of history and mountains, you’re going to love the\nSlovenian Alpine Museum\nsituated in the village.\nMojstrana is situated right at the beginning of the three\nTriglav Alpine valleys – Vrata, Krma and Kot\n. Both Vrata and Krma can be reached by car and are a paradise for any outdoor enthusiast, regardless of how much energy they would like to spend. In Krma, you can enjoy a walk past green meadows, surrounded by steeply-rising surrounding mountains and enjoy an authentic meal in the Kovinarska hut at the end.\nThe Vrata valley offers even more beautiful sights, the first of these being the 52 metres high\nPeričnik waterfall\n, behind which you can even walk! If you continue up the valley along the Triglavska Bistrica river, you’ll arrive at the\nAljaž hut\nfrom where you can stare in awe at the mighty\nTriglav north face\n, rising 1200 metres from the valley, ending in the highest peak of the country.\nVrata valley\nUpper Sava Valley and Kranjska Gora\nIf you continue down the main road along the Sava Dolinka river, you will soon arrive in Gozd Martuljek for\none of the more magnificent views of the Julian Alps\nfrom the valley. The panorama is characterized by the sharp peak of Špik with its neighbours and is a must-stop for some photos.\nIf you’re also up for a short hike, walk for half an hour to reach the\nLower Martuljek Waterfall\n. For an even better view of the Martuljek mountain chain, hike\npast the Jerman waterfall to Srednji Vrh village\n.\nJust a short drive ahead you will reach\nKranjska Gora\n, the all-year-round hotspot for outdoor activities, especially winter skiing. From there you can go to the\nZelenci Nature Reserve\nand walk on the wooden footpath to the viewing platform above the emerald spring lake surrounded by mountains. You can also visit the\nPlanica Nordic Centre\nwith the once biggest ski flying hill in the world. Optionally, hike from Planica between the grey peaks in the\nTamar Valley\nto the authentic hut for a meal.\nOn your drive south from Kranjska Gora, stop by at\nLake Jasna\nand replenish yourselves with a drink and a view of the Julian Alps reflecting in the lake. From the lake, follow the river Velika Pišnica and hike to the end of the\nKrnica Valley\n, surrounded by the 2400 metre high peaks all around.\nOn the western side of the valley lies the scenic Russian road to the Vršič pass, with its 1611 metres the highest pass in the Eastern Julian Alps. On its 50 hairpin bends (“serpentine” in Slovene), you can see the wooden\nRussian Chapel\n, built in 1917 in memory of the Russian prisoners of war who died during its construction. Higher up, keep an eye open for the\nface in the cliffs – the Heathen Maiden\n, and the\nnatural window in the Prisank north face\n.\nThe Valley of the Soča River\nAfter you descend the “serpentine” from the Vršič pass, you reach the valley of the 138-kilometre\nSoča River\n, the beautiful emerald river of western Slovenia. Just at the second to last hairpin turn, you can turn off for the short but difficult hike to the\nsource of the Soča river\n. The river first streams through the\nTrenta Valley\nsettled with charming settlements with traditional homesteads of wood and stone.\nContinue driving along the river and stop by to rest by the emerald green pools of the\nSoča Gorge\n. Turn right at the\nGreat Soča Gorge\nand continue into the pristine\nLepena Valley\nwith the Lepenjca stream. For the most relaxing experience there, visit the\nŠunik Water Grove\nand take a moment to the melody of water running over moss-covered rocks.\nSoča valley is also home to many water sports\n."
