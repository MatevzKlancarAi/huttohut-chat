  "content": "For a more adventurous day, try out some of the more wild\nactivities on the Soča river\nlike rafting, kayaking or canyoning.\nKayaking fun on Soča River\nMake the most of your trip\nVisiting all of these attractions would mean more than 250 kilometres of driving, never mind the relaxing, hiking and walking, which are probably the more desirable part of your trip. That’s why we recommend you\nsplit your exploration of the Triglav National Park into multiple days\n.\nTo make the most of your trip, it’s best to split them off into areas as described above. For a great day trip, you can combine the Triglav Valleys, Upper Sava Valley and the sights around Kranjska Gora into a one-day\nTriglav National Park Tour from Ljubljana\n.\nTo shorten your drive back from the furthermost region of the Soča Valley and make it a circular trip, you can\nboard a motorail train\nin Most na Soči that will take you under the Julian Alps through the longest tunnel in Slovenia to Bohinjska Bistrica. What’s even better is that on the way to the train, you can also visit the alpine towns of\nBovec, Kobarid and Tolmin\n.\nFor an alternative to the above, drive through the idyllic alpine village of Log pod Mangartom and across the\nPredil pass\nto Italy. Stop by the beautiful\nPredil Lake\n(“Lago del Predil” in Italian), drive through Tarvisio and rest by the beautiful\nFusine Lakes\nwith the view of the third highest mountain in Slovenia, Mount Mangart, in the background. After that, just drive back across the border to Slovenia and you’re right back in Kranjska Gora.\nCycling Tours\nMost of the sights described above can be easily reached by bike\n, which you can either transport with your car or rent in your starting town. As for a few exceptions, there aren’t any steep climbs on our ride to reach the most beautiful parts of the Park.\nYour cycling tour can get even better where there is a bike track separate from the road. The most beautiful example of this is a\nbike tour from Mojstrana to Zelenci Nature Reserve\n, accompanied by the constant views of the Julian Alps when riding through the Upper Sava Valley.\nFor a few days of riding around the Park, a\ncycling holiday around the Bled area\nis also a great choice. With an electric mountain bike, you can\ndiscover the vast forests of Pokljuka and Jelovica plateaus\nwith their hidden alpine pastures and peaceful gravel roads.\nThose looking for more of a challenge are also in the right place. With its 800 of elevation gain,\nVršič pass is a must-do for every road-cycling enthusiast\n. For the ultimate Slovenia cycling experience, combine it with Pokljuka plateau, the Mangart saddle and the Predil pass for a perfect\nJulian Alps road cycling holiday\n.\nHiking Tours\nTriglav National Park wouldn’t be the same if it would have been interspersed with roads. That’s why\nthe most pristine natural jewels can be only reached by hiking\n, which is still the best way to explore the park in full.\nHiking in Pokljuka Plateau\nThe Park is home to many trails of all difficulties. That means that it is also suitable for those who want a less strenuous experience, while still being on their feet. For example, take a week driving around the Triglav National Park on a walking holiday, hiking on trails that take you to places that you cannot reach by car, while the walking is mostly leisurely.\nOf course, you need to work a little bit to reach the untouched beauty of the park. For those ready for a more sporty way to enjoy their days in Slovenia,\nhiking hut to hut\nin the diverse mountainous landscape of the country is the way to go.\nOther Adventures\nThe Park’s terrain is so diverse that it is a space for many different activities besides hiking and biking. As we already mentioned, the rivers are often a good spot for\nkayaking\n,\nrafting\nor\ncanyoning,\nand the lakes that are not in the high-altitude like Lake Bohinj and Jasna are also perfect for\nswimming\n. As a different way of moving in the mountains, two popular activities are\nrock climbing\nand\ntrail running\n, both becoming increasingly popular.\nDuring winter, lots of these summer activities are not possible anymore, but a bunch of new ones are. Most of the mountains become a great spot for\nski-touring\nor\nsnowshoeing\n, while you can also find a lot of tracks for\ncross-country skiing\n. Sometimes one of the waterfalls we can marvel at through the year freezes in the winter, and you can also go\nice climbing\n.. Even though Slovenia only has one national park,\none day isn’t enough to see all of its beauty\n. Each voyage into this territory is a day full of childlike wonder, as there is always something new and unexpected to see. Even locals haven’t seen half of it.\nFirst the collision of tectonic plates, then the sculpturing by water; All this made the mountainous landscape of the Triglav National Park, as it is today. Full of\ngrey limestone mountain groups\n,\nsharp ridges\n, high-altitude\nkarst plateaus\n, U-shaped\nglacial valleys\n, deep\nravines\n,\ncrystal clear streams\n, majestic\nwaterfalls\nand more.\nAll of the above can be seen from afar, but it gets even more diverse if you look closer. The Park is full of various ecosystems.\nForests, peat bogs, streams and rivers\nare the most reachable, as they are more prevalent at lower altitudes. Going higher into “the kingdom of the Goldhorn”, the alpine lakes are surrounded by high-altitude\nmeadows\n, and\nrock cliffs\ntower over\nscree fields\n.\nRoad to Mangart Slovenia\nIt is a paradise for nature lovers, but don’t worry, it is not absent from human activity.\nThe area is also rich in cultural heritage\n. Especially on the outskirts of the Park, man has adapted to nature and became a part of it. From the historic\nVršič Pass\nroad with the Russian Chapel, the\nWW1 remains\nin the Krn range, the\nAljaž Turret\non the top of Triglav, to the many\nalpine pastures with authentic dwellings\n, they all became an important part of the landscape.\nSightseeing Trips\nThe easiest way to see the beauty of the Triglav National Park is by\ncar\n, as the park is a relatively short drive from the capital city of Ljubljana. The park is also well covered by roads, mostly with enough space to park close to the main attractions. If you’re unsure where to turn in regards to hiring a car, you can check out specialised services such as\nKAYAK\n.\nLake Bohinj and the Pokljuka Plateau\nAbout half an hour of a highway drive from Ljubljana, take a turnoff for Lake Bled. Although this highly popular destination is itself not in the Park, it is from where you can reach the bigger\nLake Bohinj\nand the\nPokljuka plateau\n, which are.\nBesides swimming in the clean water of Lake Bohinj, take a gondola lift to the\npanoramic Vogel mountain\nor check out the\nMostnica Gorge in the Voje valley\n. If you’re feeling more adventurous, try out kayaking or\nrafting on the Sava Bohinjka river\n.\nAerial view of Bohinj valley\nThe Pokljuka plateau is covered by spruce forest,\nperfect for relaxing walks in nature\n."
