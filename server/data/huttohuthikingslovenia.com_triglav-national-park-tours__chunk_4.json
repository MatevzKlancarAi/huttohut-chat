  "content": "For the ultimate Slovenia cycling experience, combine it with Pokljuka plateau, the Mangart saddle and the Predil pass for a perfect\nJulian Alps road cycling holiday\n.\nHiking Tours\nTriglav National Park wouldn’t be the same if it would have been interspersed with roads. That’s why\nthe most pristine natural jewels can be only reached by hiking\n, which is still the best way to explore the park in full.\nHiking in Pokljuka Plateau\nThe Park is home to many trails of all difficulties. That means that it is also suitable for those who want a less strenuous experience, while still being on their feet. For example, take a week driving around the Triglav National Park on a walking holiday, hiking on trails that take you to places that you cannot reach by car, while the walking is mostly leisurely.\nOf course, you need to work a little bit to reach the untouched beauty of the park. For those ready for a more sporty way to enjoy their days in Slovenia,\nhiking hut to hut\nin the diverse mountainous landscape of the country is the way to go.\nOther Adventures\nThe Park’s terrain is so diverse that it is a space for many different activities besides hiking and biking. As we already mentioned, the rivers are often a good spot for\nkayaking\n,\nrafting\nor\ncanyoning,\nand the lakes that are not in the high-altitude like Lake Bohinj and Jasna are also perfect for\nswimming\n. As a different way of moving in the mountains, two popular activities are\nrock climbing\nand\ntrail running\n, both becoming increasingly popular.\nDuring winter, lots of these summer activities are not possible anymore, but a bunch of new ones are. Most of the mountains become a great spot for\nski-touring\nor\nsnowshoeing\n, while you can also find a lot of tracks for\ncross-country skiing\n. Sometimes one of the waterfalls we can marvel at through the year freezes in the winter, and you can also go\nice climbing\n.."
