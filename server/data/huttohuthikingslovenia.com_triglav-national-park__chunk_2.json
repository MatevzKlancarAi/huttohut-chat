It was made possible by an initiative by the Nature Protection Section of the Slovene Museum Society together with the Slovene Mountaineering Society for a twenty-year lease taken on the Triglav Lakes Valley area.\nThe name “Triglav National Park” was used soon after in 1926, by a botanist and a plant geneticist Fran Jesenko.\nTrenta valley\nIn 1961, the protection act was renewed and the name of the park was changed to Triglav National Park.\nEven though it held the name of our highest mountain, the park only protected the wider area of the Triglav Lakes Valley, from Kanjavec peak to Savica Waterfall.\nFinally, in 1981, the Law of the Triglav National Park was passed and its present borders, containing most of the Julian Alps, were outlined.\nFrom the 20 square kilometres protected at first, it enlarged to an area of 840 square kilometres it covers nowadays.\nTNP’s vision mission\nThe priority objectives of the park are\nconservation of ecosystems and natural processes, natural assets, diversity of habitats, plant and animal species, landscape quality and landscape diversity.\nIn the park’s area which is settled, the main focus is to\nsafeguard the\ncultural heritage and quality of land\n, which arose from the harmony between man and nature.\nNature’s wellbeing is our responsibility\nThe Park wants to provide you with a rich experience of its natural beauty, but remember – we are all just guests of this highly sensitive natural environment, so when we pay it a visit, we must take on the responsibility to help maintain its state of preservation.\nHere are the most important rules of conduct in the Park:\nPark your vehicle in one of the many designated car parks.\nStay on the marked trails and keep your noise levels down to not disturb the animals.\nDogs must be kept on a leash.\nRespect the flora and fauna."
