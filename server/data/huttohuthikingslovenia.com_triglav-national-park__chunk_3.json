Hiking in the valleys, hills or lower valleys can be done from spring to autumn, sometimes even winter. Ascending higher peaks is best done in summer since the snow is mostly melted. If you want stable weather with the least afternoon storms possible, September is the month to go.\nWhat to pack?\nIf you won’t just stick to the valley, it’s best to\npack some warmer layers of clothing\nsince temperature changes are quite common in the Julian Alps. Even though you might not feel its warmth, the sun’s UV strength increases by more than 30 % for each additional 1000 metres of elevation you reach. That means it’s much easier to get sunburnt in the mountains, so you\nshouldn’t forget to put on your sunscreen and bring your sunglasses\n.\nFor more tips related to hiking in the Triglav National Park, check out our\nUltimate Guide\n.\nStaying in the park\nAccommodation options in the Park can satisfy any kind of visitor.
