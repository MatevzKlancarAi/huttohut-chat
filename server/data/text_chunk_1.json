  "content": "General questions\nLuggage transfers\nIn general, luggage transfers are not possible in Slovenia's mountain regions. Most mountain huts are inaccessible by car, meaning you will need to carry your own belongings. However, you won’t need to bring much—huts provide bedding and food, and you can refill your water bottles along the way, allowing you to travel light.\n\nIf your tour starts and ends in different locations, we can arrange for luggage to be transferred between them. Additionally, it often makes sense to book a night in a hotel in the valley before your hike. We can assist with this booking, and you can leave any excess luggage at the hotel for convenience.\n\nPrivate rooms\nPrivate rooms in mountain huts are limited and tend to get booked out first, so early booking is essential. They are also pricier than dormitory-style accommodation, with a supplement of around €30 per night.\n\nThe size of private rooms varies—some are for two people, while others accommodate 3 to 6 guests. If you prefer a private room, let us know, and we will do our best to secure one for you. However, due to high demand, we cannot guarantee availability.\n\nRegardless of the room type, bathrooms in mountain huts are always shared.\n\nWhat you need with you\nTry to pack light and only take what is necessary. It is always good to plan according to the route, the weather and other specific conditions, which means it’s best to consult with a guide before doing so.\nClothing:\nComfortable sports clothes\nSports shoes with good grip\nInsulation jacket\nExtra layers\nRain jacket\nHeadwear\nGloves\nSpare socks, underwear and shirts\n\nEven though it is summer and the weather is warm, it’s good to take enough extra layers, so you don’t get cold when the temperatures suddenly drop. We also recommend having a good softshell jacket for wind protection, and a rain jacket when the forecast is sketchy.\n\nThe most important item you’ll have with you are your shoes. They need to be comfortable and previously worn, as that will lessen your chances of getting blisters substantially. Never go on a multi-day tour with new shoes! Low-cut hiking shoes or trail running shoes are good enough for any summer tour in Slovenia when the weather is dry. But the shoes must be sturdy enough to protect your feet from the rocks and have a grippy outsole that prevents slippage. Do not go on a hike in regular sports sneakers! In early summer (for crossing the snow left) or rainy days, it’s better to wear high-cut waterproof shoes or even boots.\nFor overnight stays in huts:\nSleeping liner (disposable can be bought in the hut)\nSome cash for food and accommodation\nUIAA membership card for accommodation discount\nToothbrush\nEarplugs\nID card\nPowerbank or plug divider(power sockets are often taken)\n\nCredit cards are usually accepted in huts, but because they depend on the unreliable internet signal, it’s best to also take enough cash. An ID card is necessary for the hut check-in, where you can also present your UIAA membership card to get a discount. A sleeping bag is not needed, as the hut provides all the blankets, bedding and pillows.\nOther equipment:\nHiking backpack 25-30 l\nTrekking poles (if you are used to them)\nSnacks (for the time between huts)\nWater bottle with enough water and a sports drink with electrolytes\nSunscreen\nToilet paper\nHeadlamp\n\nMountain huts general information\nGeneral Comfort\nAs the huts are often secluded and “away from civilization,” the general comfort is basic. However, they are clean, cozy, and well-equipped for an overnight stay. Expect simple but functional facilities that provide everything you need to rest and recharge.\nSleeping Accommodation\nMost huts offer both dormitory-style accommodation and private rooms. Private rooms get booked out quickly, so early reservations are essential. Beds are generally comfortable, and huts provide blankets, bedding, and pillows, but bringing your own sleeping bag liner is recommended for extra hygiene. Some huts require a liner, and if you don’t have one, you may need to buy a disposable version.\nWater & Showering Facilities\nLower-altitude huts usually have their own drinking water source.\nHigher-altitude huts often do not have a natural water supply and rely on helicopter deliveries. Most collect rainwater for toilets, but showers are typically available only in lower-altitude huts.\nDrinking water is available, but in high-altitude huts, you may need to buy bottled water (€4.5 per 1.5L), or alternatively, bring a water filter to purify collected rainwater.\nFood & Dietary Options\nHuts offer hearty, traditional Slovenian cuisine, including homemade stews, sausages, and goulash, providing a warm and satisfying meal after a day of hiking. Breakfast typically features eggs, fresh bread, and various spreads, making the half-board package a convenient and worthwhile option.\n\nIn addition to meals, huts serve beer, wine, and home-brewed schnapps, along with snacks like chocolate bars for a quick energy boost.\n\nIf you pass a hut along your route, you’ll usually have the opportunity to stop for a light lunch. In the daily itinerary handout, we will specify whether you’ll pass a convenient place for lunch or if it’s better to order a packed lunch from your overnight hut to take with you on the trail.\nDietary restrictions:\nVegetarian meals are always available.\nVegan and gluten-free options are possible, but quite limited.\nElectricity & Charging\nMost huts rely on solar panels or generators, meaning electricity is limited. Charging phones or other electronic devices is usually only possible in common areas, and some huts charge a small fee for this service. Bringing a power bank is a good idea.\nToilets & Hygiene\nLower-altitude huts typically have flush toilets.\nHigher-altitude huts may only have outhouses.\nIt's recommended to bring your own toilet paper and hand sanitizer, as these may not always be provided.\nShowers are a scarcity in our huts. Out of high alpine mountain huts, only Vodnikov Dom has a shower, and a few valley located huts (Aljažev Dom, Dom Klementa Juga, Uskovnica). If it is a dry summer, showers can be unavailable.\nPayments & Booking Conditions\nMost huts accept credit cards, but not all, so bringing some cash is highly recommended.\nConnectivity & Signal\nThere is NO Wi-Fi in huts.\nMobile data signal is generally decent, but coverage varies—some areas have no signal at all. Download offline maps before your hike.\nDogs & Pets\nDogs are generally NOT allowed in Slovenian mountain huts. \nSleeping Arrangements & Noise\nEarplugs are highly recommended—whether in a dorm or a private room, huts can be noisy.\nEven in private rooms, expect limited privacy—they are simple and functional, not hotel-like.\nMountain Hut Etiquette\nQuiet hours are from 10 PM to 5 AM. Be mindful of others, especially when waking up early.\nSmoking inside huts is not allowed.\nPack out your trash—everyone is responsible for taking their waste back down to the valley."
