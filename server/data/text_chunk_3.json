While you may encounter more people on trails closer to the valleys, they are far from busy, and once you venture higher into the mountains, the paths become much quieter. There will be stretches where you’ll barely meet anyone, allowing you to fully enjoy the tranquility of nature. However, you are never too remote, as the trails are well-marked, and huts are spaced at reasonable distances, providing shelter, food, and a sense of security along the way.\n\nBest sesason\nMost mountain huts in Slovenia are open from late June to the end of September, as snow often lingers in the mountains well into spring. Some huts remain open in October if the weather permits, but by November, most huts close for the winter season.\nEarly Summer (Late June – Early July) – Lush Green & Fewer People\nEarly summer is one of the most beautiful times to hike in Slovenia’s mountains. The valleys and alpine meadows are lush green and in full bloom, creating stunning scenery. There are also fewer hikers in late June and early July, as many people wait for peak summer, making the trails more peaceful. Additionally, the days are long, allowing for longer hikes with plenty of daylight.\nPeak Summer (Late July – August) – Warmer but Busier\nAs the season progresses and August approaches, the trails become busier, especially in popular areas. The temperatures are higher, and the weather tends to be more unpredictable, with afternoon thunderstorms becoming more frequent. However, this is also a time when all huts are open, making it the most flexible period for planning.\nEarly Autumn (September) – Stable Weather & Fewer Crowds\nSeptember is often the best time to go for those who prefer a balance of good weather and fewer people. The temperatures are cooler, and the weather is more stable than in August. Additionally, the huts are less crowded, making it easier to secure accommodation. However, there are two small downsides: mornings can be very cold, and the days are shorter, meaning you need to start your hikes earlier to take advantage of daylight.\nOctober & Late Season Hiking – Fewer Options, But Still Possible\nBy October, most huts begin to close, but a few may remain open if there’s no early snowfall. For those looking to hike in the early or late season, an alternative option is the Triglav Panorama Hut-to-Hut Hike. This route uses huts that remain open longer into autumn, allowing for a scenic and enjoyable experience even outside the main hiking season.\nWinter & Off-Season Hiking\nFrom November onwards, most huts are closed, and snow covers the trails, making independent hut-to-hut hiking impractical. However, winter hikes and ski touring options exist for those experienced in cold-weather mountaineering.\n\nIf you’re unsure about seasonal availability or want help planning the best time for your hike, feel free to reach out for recommendations!\n\nHow soon should we book\nThe best advice is to book as early as possible. A good rule of thumb is that after New Year's, reservations start filling up quickly, and by early spring, some dates or specific huts may already be fully booked.\n\nEach year, last-minute bookings are becoming harder to secure, especially in peak season (July–August). However, if you remain flexible with your dates, we can usually find an available tour and adjust accordingly.\n\nTo ensure you get your preferred itinerary and dates, we recommend booking several months in advance, especially if you’re looking for private rooms in huts or specific, customized hiking routes or travel in larger groups.\n\nWhat if we need help? What kind of support is offered\nFor general assistance, you can reach us via WhatsApp, and we will do our best to accommodate your needs. Whether it’s rescheduling huts, finding alternative routes, or helping with logistics, we are here to support you throughout your hike.\n\nIn case of an emergency, always contact Mountain Rescue at 112—this is the fastest and most reliable way to get immediate assistance in the mountains. Your safety is our priority, and we are always available to help with non-emergency issues to ensure a smooth and enjoyable hiking experience.\n\nCan we swim in mountain lakes?\nSwimming is allowed and encouraged in valley lakes such as Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj, where the water is clean, refreshing, and a great way to cool off after a hike.\n\nHowever, swimming in high-altitude mountain lakes, such as the Triglav Lakes, is not allowed. These lakes are part of a fragile alpine ecosystem, and human activity, including swimming, can disturb the delicate balance of the environment. To help protect these pristine waters, hikers should admire them from the shore and avoid any activities that could damage the natural habitat.\n\nTour customization\nOur hut-to-hut hiking tours are highly customizable, allowing you to create an experience that fits your schedule, preferences, and hiking abilities. Whether you want a shorter or longer itinerary, adjusted difficulty level, or specific huts and routes, we can tailor the tour to match your needs.\n\nCustomizations can include:"
