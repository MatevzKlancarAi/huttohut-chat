  "content": "Flexible Start & End Points – Choose where your hike begins and ends based on your travel plans.\nAdjusted Hiking Distances – Opt for longer or shorter hiking days, depending on your fitness level and preferences.\nPrivate Rooms & Accommodation Preferences – If available, we can try to secure private rooms in huts or arrange alternative lodging in the valley.\nAlternative Routes & Additional Side Hikes – If you want to add or avoid certain trails, we can modify the route accordingly.\nLuggage Transfers & Additional Services – If your itinerary allows, we can arrange for luggage transfers or add extra nights in hotels before or after your hike.\n\nWe are happy to adjust your trip as much as possible, ensuring you get the most out of your Slovenian hiking adventure. Let us know your preferences, and we’ll do our best to make it happen!\n\nGroup size & Single travellers\nSelf-Guided Tours\nOur self-guided tours are individually arranged for each booking, meaning that your itinerary, accommodations, and logistics are planned exclusively for you or your group. There is no fixed group to join—each booking is treated as its own independent adventure.\nGuided Tours – Private or Group Options\nFor our guided tours, you have the option to book a private tour or join a group with other travelers.\n\nGroup Size: Our general guided group tours typically have 8-10 participants per mountain guide, ensuring a personalized and safe experience.\nTriglav Ascent: Due to the more technical nature of the climb, the guide-to-participant ratio for Triglav is 1:4, ensuring safety and proper guidance on the final ascent.\nMinimum Group Size: Groups are confirmed with at least 2 participants.\nSingle Travelers\nSolo travelers are welcome! If you’re booking a guided tour alone:\n\nYou can pay a single supplement to do the hike privately.\nIf you prefer to join a group, we can try to match you with other travelers to keep the cost down.\nIf we are unable to find a group for your selected date, you will have the option to pay the supplement for a private tour or receive a full refund.\n\nWe are happy to assist in finding the best option for you based on your preferences and available groups!\n\nAdditional costs\nWhile most expenses are included in your tour package, there are a few additional costs to keep in mind:\n\nDinner in Mountain Huts – If your package does not include half-board, expect to pay around €10-15 per meal in the huts. Meals are homemade, hearty, and typically include traditional Slovenian dishes.\nDrinks & Snacks – Bottled water, soft drinks, beer, and snacks (such as chocolate bars) are available for purchase in most huts. A 1.5L bottle of water costs around €4.5.\nShowers – Some huts charge a small fee for hot showers, usually around €3-4 for a few minutes.\nTipping Your Guide (for guided tours) – While not obligatory, tipping your guide €10-20 per person per day is a much-appreciated way to show gratitude for their service.\n\nThese costs vary slightly depending on location and season, so we recommend bringing some cash, as many mountain huts do not accept credit cards.\n\nInsurance\nTravel and hiking insurance is not included in our tours, but we strongly recommend having coverage in case of unexpected situations such as accidents, injuries, or trip cancellations.\n\nFor those hiking in Slovenia, one great option is mountain rescue insurance through the Alpine Association of Slovenia (PZS). This insurance covers mountain rescue costs, including helicopter rescue if needed. You can purchase it online through PZS Membership & Insurance: https://clanarina.pzs.si/?lang=2\n\nAlternatively, check if your travel insurance includes mountain sports coverage, especially for higher-altitude trekking or alpine terrain.\n\nWhere to stay before the tour\nMost travelers choose to stay in Bled, as it is conveniently located, well-connected, and offers a great atmosphere before or after the hike. Bled is close to Ljubljana Airport, public transport connections, and major highways, making it an easy starting or ending point. Plus, it’s a beautiful destination in its own right, with Lake Bled, Bled Castle, and great dining options.\n\nDepending on your tour itinerary, you may also consider staying in:\n\nBohinj – A quieter, nature-focused alternative to Bled, right by Lake Bohinj, offering beautiful scenery and a relaxing atmosphere.\nMojstrana – A small alpine village closer to Triglav National Park, ideal for those starting hikes in the Vrata Valley or Julian Alps.\nKranjska Gora – A well-known mountain town, perfect for those exploring the northern Julian Alps or continuing travels into Austria or Italy.\n\nWe can help arrange pre- and post-tour accommodations in these locations based on your travel plans!\n\nTour specific\nHow difficult is the tour\nTriglav 3-day Hut-to-Hut Tour & Triglav 2-Day Tour\nDifficulty Level: Challenging (Technical Sections on Summit Day)\n\nMost of the route is moderate, following well-marked trails, but the ascent to Triglav’s summit is exposed and technical. The final climb includes via ferrata (secured climbing sections with steel cables and footholds), where you will be secured with safety equipment. While no previous climbing experience is required, it is strongly recommended that hikers have:\n\nBasic hiking experience on uneven terrain\nSure footing (good balance and confidence on rocky trails)\nNo fear of heights (exposed sections may feel intimidating)\n\nThe tour requires 5-7 hours of hiking per day, carrying medium-heavy backpacks over varied terrain, including steep ascents, rocky sections, and some scrambling. Weather can significantly impact difficulty, especially in rain, wind, or snow, making early booking and flexibility important. If you are unsure about the technical section, alternative hikes without the summit climb are available.\n\nSeven Lakes Hut-to-Hut Hike, The Best of the Julian Alps & Soča Valley Hike, Triglav Panorama Hike, Slovenian Mountain Trail Highlights Hike\nDifficulty Level: Moderate (No Technical Sections, Some Uneven Terrain)\n\nThese tours are suitable for most hikers with basic experience and a reasonable level of fitness. Expect 5-7 hours of hiking per day, including breaks, with light to moderately weighted backpacks.\n\nWhat to Expect on These Tours:\nWell-marked trails, but some narrow and uneven paths\nLoose and rocky sections requiring careful footing\nNo significant exposure or technical climbing\nModerate elevation gain/loss (varies by tour)\n\nThese hikes offer a rewarding alpine experience, allowing you to explore Slovenia’s most scenic landscapes without technical challenges. However, hikers should still be prepared for changing weather, as rain can make trails slippery, and higher elevations can be chilly even in summer."
